Description of Project:

Customer: The customer is central to the application's functionality, interacting with both the product and gambling features. After entering their name and balance, the customer can browse available products, add items to their shopping cart, and adjust quantities as needed.

Browsing Products: Customers can browse through categories of products. Each category contains multiple products with their respective prices, names, and quantities.

Adding Products to Cart: A customer can add products to their shopping cart. They also have the option to specify the quantity of each product they wish to purchase.

Checking Out: Once the customer has finished shopping, they can proceed to checkout. The total price of the products in the cart is calculated, and the amount is deducted from their balance.

Playing Slots: The customer has the option to play a slot machine game. They guess a number between 1 and 10. If their guessed number matches the randomly generated number, they win double their guess amount.

Money Management: The application allows the customer to manage their balance. They can add more money to their account and choose to bet money in the slot machine game. If they win, their balance is increased accordingly.

Product and Category Management: Each product is associated with a Category, and every Category contains a list of products. The customer can view product details, and the store administrator (or the system) can manage products and categories.
